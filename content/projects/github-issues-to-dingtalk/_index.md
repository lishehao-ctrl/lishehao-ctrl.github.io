## Overview
A lightweight automation tool that synchronizes GitHub Issues activity to
DingTalk, enabling teams to receive real-time updates without constantly
monitoring GitHub.

- Notification overload
- Context switching between tools
- Delayed manual checking

## Solution
This project bridges GitHub Issues and DingTalk by automatically forwarding
issue events to DingTalk, ensuring that key updates are visible to the entire team.

## Features
- Automatic issue event forwarding
- Near real-time notifications
- Simple configuration and deployment

## Use Cases
- Team issue tracking
- Project status monitoring
- Faster response to critical updates
