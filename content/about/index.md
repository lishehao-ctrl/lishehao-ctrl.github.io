I'm Shehao Li, a UC San Diego student who builds practical software close to real workflows—measurement automation, data analysis pipelines, and tooling that makes messy processes repeatable.

Right now, I’m leaning toward ML-oriented engineering with a focus on reproducible experiments and systematic debugging.

## Background

- UC San Diego (UCSD)
- Major: Math–Computer Science
- Academic direction: Cognitive Science (Machine Learning track) / ML-focused coursework and projects

## Current focus

- Building and documenting small, reliable systems with clear inputs/outputs
- Test and lab automation patterns (instrument control, logging, repeatable runs)
- Data analysis workflows where results can be reproduced end-to-end
- Learning to design experiments so results are traceable and comparable over time

## How I work

- Break problems into small, testable steps
- Prefer repeatable runs over one-off results
- Debug systematically 

## Selected work

- **Projects**: See [Projects](/projects/) for write-ups, architecture notes, and constraints.
