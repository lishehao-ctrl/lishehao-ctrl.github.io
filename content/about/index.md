I’m Shehao Li, a UC San Diego undergraduate majoring in Math–Computer Science.

I enjoy building practical software that makes real workflows more repeatable: test/measurement automation, small tools that turn messy inputs into structured outputs, and web prototypes that people can actually use.

I’m interested in machine learning. Long term, I want to work at the intersection of **ML and experiment/evaluation infrastructure**—the engineering side that makes results reproducible, comparable, and easier to debug.

## Background

* UC San Diego (UCSD)
* Major: Math–Computer Science

## What I’ve worked on

* **Test & measurement automation**
  Built Python-based automation for lab-style workflows (instrument control patterns, repeatable runs, and structured logging). A recurring theme in my projects is designing runs so results can be reproduced later and compared across changes.

* **Workflow automation tools**
  Built small scripts that convert incoming information into trackable tasks (with attention to idempotency so the system stays consistent when inputs repeat).

* **Web system prototype (in progress)**
  Prototyping a real-time queue-style web app idea (Office Hours / TA Queue): students join a queue, staff manage help flow, and the system can later support basic analytics.

## Current focus

* Building and documenting small, reliable systems with clear inputs/outputs
* Learning ML fundamentals while keeping an engineering mindset about evaluation
* Making test runs traceable with logs/metrics and consistent data formats
* Designing workflows that are repeatable instead of one-off demos

## How I work

* Break problems into small, testable components
* Instrument early (logs, metrics, intermediate outputs)
* Debug by narrowing variables, not guessing
* Prefer “re-run and compare” over “it worked once”

## Selected work

* **Projects**: See [Projects](/projects/) for write-ups and technical notes.
