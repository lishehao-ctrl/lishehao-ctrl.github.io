I build systems that make machine learning experiments reliable under real-world constraints.

My work sits at the intersection of machine learning and experiment
infrastructure. Rather than focusing only on training models, I design
workflows that support reproducible runs, automated evaluation, regression
detection, and traceable results when things break.

My background in test and measurement automation strongly shapes how I
approach ML. I treat experiments as test runs, metrics as measurements,
and failures as signals to debug systematically — not noise to ignore.

I’m currently focused on ML-oriented engineering with an emphasis on
experiment and evaluation infrastructure: building systems where results
can be reproduced weeks later, compared across versions, and trusted.

## Background

- UC San Diego (UCSD)
- Major: Math–Computer Science

I’m shaping my coursework and projects around systems that support
experiments: data collection, logging, analysis, and iteration,
rather than one-off demos.

## Current focus

- Building and documenting small, reliable systems with clear inputs/outputs
- Test and lab automation patterns (instrument control, logging, repeatable runs)
- Data analysis workflows where results can be reproduced end-to-end
- Learning to design experiments so results are traceable and comparable over time

## How I work

- Decompose problems into small, testable components
- Design runs so results can be reproduced weeks later
- Instrument early: logs, metrics, intermediate outputs
- Debug by narrowing variables, not guessing

## Selected work

- **Projects**: See [Projects](/projects/) for write-ups, architecture notes, and constraints.
